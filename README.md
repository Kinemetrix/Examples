Example Projects
====================
1. CppCLIWrapperForCSharp - uses C++/CLI (managed) to wrap C# code for use in native C++ applications

2. CppLibInC - creates a C++ DLL then uses wrapper functions to use a class defined in the DLL in a C application

3. HostCLR - hosts the common language runtime in native C++ to execute code in a C# DLL

4. UnmanagedExports - exports C# class methods into C/C++.  It does NOT export classes.
